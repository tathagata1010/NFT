# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npm install dotenv---------->To connect metamask with the deployment process.
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
npm install @alch/achemy-web3------->web3 Js installation
node scripts/mint-NFT.js
```
